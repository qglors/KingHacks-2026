Serolens is a play on words between serology (the study of blood serum that focuses on detecting antibodies) and lens (like a camera lens for computer vision). Right now, there's a lot of guesswork when it comes to our bodies and immune systems. By getting AI (computer vision and data analysis) to analyze a test strip, instead of a simple positive/negative, we can receive more quantitive information about our antibody levels. This can help in many ways: cutting the waiting time to receive test results, getting more information about our antibodies, this program could replace a lot of expensive lab equipment that may not be as accessible in certain areas, and vaccination schedules can be more personalized (rather than just every 6 months for everyone) because everyone's body is different. In addition to that, this can be an efficient form of data collection pertaining to people's health through anonymous data. This means if there's another virus outbreak, we'll be able to know faster and can lockdown the area almost immediately.
